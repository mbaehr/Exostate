System to store, broadcast, and rebroadcast announcements

Announcements are identified by a handle of the form [hostname:name]

Example:
  mia-db01a:db_state
  rwc-bak01:backup_state

A daemon joins a multicast group and listens for (and stores)
all announcements.

A "want" announcement is also supported, with an optional freshness
constraint.  This will cause anyone with a copy of the announcement
that's suitably fresh to rebroadcast it.

For example, mia-db01a is interested in the state of mia-db01b.

It will announce that it "wants" mia-db01b:db_state, no older than
3600 seconds ago.

Any daemon with a suitably fresh copy of that announcement will
rebroadcast it.  If mia-db01b is running a daemon, it will rebroadcast
the latest version of its announcement (assuming it is holding a copy)
unconditionally, because it is considered authoritative for that handle.

This way, a host that has not been part of the multicast "cloud" can
quickly come up to speed.

This is built to be integrated into decision-making systems, with an
emphasis on distributed, fault-tolerant orchestration.
